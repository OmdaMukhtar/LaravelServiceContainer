# This lesson has shown you the benefits that OOP brings to a project and to a programmer.
# You have learned how to :
1. Keep your analysis in the business world, using business words, with encapsulation of related strings and numbers into classes
2. Make teamwork more productive by separating classes that require specialized knowledge from those that do not.
3. Achieve reuse without instruction lists from the programmer who wrote the code you are reusing.
4. Compare the responsibilities of your classes with the overall project scope to ensure nothing's been forgotten.
